# Serverless
This project contains info on creating serverless projects

**What it does**
This is a repository of various Lambdas that I have written over the years. They do various tasks such as CRUD operation in Dynamo, fetch image from S3, post event to Amazon EventBridge, check EC2 tags etc. Please let me know if you have aquestion on a specific program.

Things I learned
AWS Lambda
Python coding
AWS API SDK (Boto3)
Event driven patterns
DynamoDB
How to run?
Create a Lambda function from AWS console with Python as the language
Create appropriate IAM role
Once Lambda is created, paste the code from the python programs into your Lambda code
Save and run the Lambda function!
